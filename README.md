Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Answer: The key milestones in th evolution of software engineering includes:
1 - Software engineering as an art
2 - Software engineering transition from art to craft
3 - Software engineering transition from craft to an engineering discipline

Software engineering as an art refers to the creative and intuitive aspect of software development. It involves the use of creativity, problem-solving skills, and artistic expression to design and develop software systems that are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. Here, programmers would often write code in an ad-hoc manner, without much structure or planning, and the final product was often the result of their personal artistic expression.

Software Engineering Transition from Art to Craft
The transition of software engineering from an art to a craft can be seen as a gradual process that has occurred over time. As software systems have become more complex and important, it became clear that the traditional ad-hoc approach to software development is not sufficient. This led to the emergence of the field of software engineering, which focused on bringing more structure and discipline to the software development process. Instead of relying on the creativity and intuition of individual programmers, software development has become more structured and disciplined, with a focus on using established processes and methodologies to ensure the quality and reliability of software systems therefore shifting the focus from the artistic expression of individual programmers to the use of established processes and methodologies.

Software Engineering Transition From Craft To Engineering Discipline
The transition of software engineering from a craft to an engineering discipline can be seen as a gradual process that has occurred over time as the field has matured. One of the key milestones in the transition of software engineering from a craft to an engineering discipline was the publication of the book “Software Engineering: A Practitioner’s Approach” by Pressman in 1975. This book provided a comprehensive overview of the field and defined software engineering as an engineering discipline. With the growing recognition of software engineering as an engineering discipline, the focus has shifted from the use of established processes and methodologies to ensure the quality and reliability of software systems, to a more scientific and systematic approach to software development. This has led to the development of new techniques and methodologies such as formal methods, model-driven development, and software architecture, which are based on sound scientific principles and are designed to ensure the quality and reliability of software systems.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Answer: The software development life cycle includes:
Stage-1: Planning and Requirement Analysis
Stage-2: Defining Requirements
Stage-3: Designing Architecture
Stage-4: Developing Product
Stage-5: Product Testing and Integration
Stage-6: Deployment and Maintenance of Products

Stage-1: Planning and Requirement Analysis
Planning is a crucial step in everything, just as in software development. In this same stage, requirement analysis is also performed by the developers of the organization. This is attained from customer inputs, and sales department/market surveys. The information from this analysis forms the building blocks of a basic project. The quality of the project is a result of planning. Thus, in this stage, the basic project is designed with all the available information. 

Stage-2: Defining Requirements
In this stage, all the requirements for the target software are specified. These requirements get approval from customers, market analysts, and stakeholders. 
This is fulfilled by utilizing SRS (Software Requirement Specification). This is a sort of document that specifies all those things that need to be defined and created during the entire project cycle. 

Stage-3: Designing Architecture
SRS is a reference for software designers to come up with the best architecture for the software. Hence, with the requirements defined in SRS, multiple designs for the product architecture are present in the Design Document Specification (DDS). This DDS is assessed by market analysts and stakeholders. After evaluating all the possible factors, the most practical and logical design is chosen for development.

Stage-4: Developing Product
At this stage, the fundamental development of the product starts. For this, developers use a specific programming code as per the design in the DDS. Hence, it is important for the coders to follow the protocols set by the association. Conventional programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are also put into use at this stage. Some popular languages like C/C++, Python, Java, etc. are put into use as per the software regulations.

Stage-5: Product Testing and Integration
After the development of the product, testing of the software is necessary to ensure its smooth execution. Although, minimal testing is conducted at every stage of SDLC. Therefore, at this stage, all the probable flaws are tracked, fixed, and retested. This ensures that the product confronts the quality requirements of SRS.

Stage-6: Deployment and Maintenance of Products
After detailed testing, the conclusive product is released in phases as per the organization’s strategy. Then it is tested in a real industrial environment. It is important to ensure its smooth performance. If it performs well, the organization sends out the product as a whole. After retrieving beneficial feedback, the company releases it as it is or with auxiliary improvements to make it further helpful for the customers. However, this alone is not enough. Therefore, along with the deployment, the product’s supervision.
